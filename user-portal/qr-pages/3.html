    Free Look period
Insurance companies provide their customers with a free look period to go through the insurance policy. In the event of the policy not impressing them, they can opt to terminate without having to pay any sorts of surrender charges. The period is set at 15 days for policies purchased manually. People who purchase policies online have a larger window of 30 days to go through the policy documents and make up their minds.
</p>
<p>
Entry Age
For term insurance plans, the entry age is set at a minimum of 18 years and a maximum of 65 years. If you are within 18 to 65 years, you can opt for more than one term plan to cover a wider range of age.
</p>
<p>
Grace Period
Just like any other insurance product, customers enjoy the benefits of grace periods. The duration varies depending on the mode of payment that you have selected. For monthly payments, the grace period is usually 15 days. Whereas the same is 30 days for annual payment mode.
</p>
<p>
Revival
Being an insurance product at heart, you do get some advantages. If you have not paid your insurance premiums for a duration of two years, you can still revive your policy.
</p>
<p>
Premium Amount
This factor of the plan depends on the age of the applicant as well as the sum assured they are looking for. The plan is usually very affordable when taken at a younger age.
</p>
<p>
Type of Plan
Term plans provide you the flexibility of choosing a single plan for yourself or a joint plan. As the name suggests, the joint plan allows coverage for more than one life. One can also choose between a term plan that gives lump sum payout in the case of an eventuality or gives lump sum plus deferred incomes to the nominees
